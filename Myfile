### Idea Title 1: Duplicate/Related Skill Flagging Tool in MySkills

**Problem Statement**  
The MySkills universal catalogue contains many closely related skills for the same technology (e.g., slightly different phrasings like "Amazon Route 53" and "AWS Route53 DNS Management"), making the interface feel cluttered and forcing users to search longer or choose between similar options when adding or validating skills.

**Idea Description**  
Add a simple "Flag Related Skills" button next to search results or added skills in MySkills. When clicked, it lets the user quickly report two or more closely related skills as potential duplicates. These flags go to a shared queue visible to admins or a skill catalogue team, who can then merge them into one primary skill (keeping the most common phrasing) and automatically update user profiles. This keeps the catalogue cleaner over time with community input.

**FTE Benefits**  
- **Soft dollar benefit (human effort)**: Reduces time spent scrolling through similar skills during profile updates.  
- **Estimated efforts saved**: 30-60 minutes per year per user (fewer searches and decisions).  
- **Qualitative benefits**: Cleaner interface, less confusion when adding skills, higher confidence in profile accuracy.  
- **Estimated BRC start**: Immediately after feature rollout (e.g., January 2026).  

**Organization Benefits**  
- Gradually improves the quality of the skill catalogue without full manual audits.  
- Encourages user participation in maintaining the tool.  

**Customer Benefits**  
- Not applicable (internal tool).  

**Estimated hard dollar benefit**: $0  
**Estimated soft dollar benefit**: $30-60 annualized per user (time saved).  
**Estimated cost of investment**: Low-moderate development effort.  
**Estimated FTE release date**: Not applicable.  
**Hard dollar annualized revenue**: $0  

### Idea Title 2: Auto-Import Skills from Certifications in MySkills

**Problem Statement**  
When trainees complete certifications like AWS DevOps, the associated skills (e.g., Route 53, EC2, S3 at a certain competency level) are known and standardized, yet users still have to manually add or pitch these skills in MySkills and wait for manager validation, even though the organization already tracks certification progress.

**Idea Description**  
Introduce an "Import from Certifications" feature in MySkills that connects to the organization's learning/certification records (or platforms like AWS Skill Builder). It scans completed or in-progress certifications, suggests the standard skill package (e.g., adds "AWS Route 53" at intermediate level for AWS DevOps cert), and lets the user confirm/add them in one click. Manager approval can be auto-skipped or fast-tracked for certification-linked skills.

**FTE Benefits**  
- **Soft dollar benefit (human effort)**: Eliminates repetitive manual entry of expected certification skills.  
- **Estimated efforts saved**: 1-2 hours per certification per user (adding and validating multiple skills).  
- **Qualitative benefits**: Keeps profiles automatically up-to-date, reduces forgotten updates, motivates course completion.  
- **Estimated BRC start**: Immediately after integration (e.g., January 2026).  

**Organization Benefits**  
- More accurate skill mapping to actual training outcomes.  
- Faster visibility into workforce capabilities post-certification.  

**Customer Benefits**  
- Not applicable (internal tool).  

**Estimated hard dollar benefit**: $0  
**Estimated soft dollar benefit**: $50-100 annualized per user (time saved).  
**Estimated cost of investment**: Moderate integration effort.  
**Estimated FTE release date**: Not applicable.  
**Hard dollar annualized revenue**: $0

### Idea Title: Simple AWS Re-Login Password Manager Snippet

**Problem Statement**  
The training AWS account expires every 2 hours, requiring re-registration and a new generated password each time. Manually copying the new password, switching to the browser, and pasting it during login is repetitive and interrupts the training flow, especially when doing multiple labs in a day.

**Idea Description**  
Create a short, reusable text snippet (or a simple Notepad++ / VS Code macro) with placeholders for the new username and password. After re-registration, copy the credentials once, paste into the snippet, and it formats a ready-to-use "Sign-in URL + filled credentials" note. Alternatively, use a free browser extension like Auto Text Expander with a shortcut (e.g., type ";awslogin") to auto-insert the formatted login details.

**FTE Benefits**  
- **Soft dollar benefit (human effort)**: Reduces repetitive copying/pasting and tab-switching during frequent re-logins.  
- **Estimated efforts saved**: 2-4 minutes per re-login, about 1-3 hours per month per trainee.  
- **Qualitative benefits**: Smoother workflow, less disruption during labs, fewer typing errors.  
- **Estimated BRC start**: Immediately after setup (e.g., December 2025).  

**Organization Benefits**  
- Minor reduction in trainee frustration and small support queries about login process.  
- Encourages consistent login habits across the batch.  

**Customer Benefits**  
- Not applicable (internal training improvement).  

**Estimated hard dollar benefit**: $0  
**Estimated soft dollar benefit**: $50-100 annualized per trainee (time saved).  
**Estimated cost of investment**: 2-5 hours trainee time (no cost).  
**Estimated FTE release date**: Not applicable.  
**Hard dollar annualized revenue**: $0










### Idea Title: Quick Role Switch Bookmark for AWS Trainee Login

**Problem Statement**  
In the temporary AWS organization account (expires every 2 hours), there are many roles listed during login, but I only have access to one specific trainee role. Finding and selecting it every time I re-register and log in is confusing and wastes valuable training time.

**Idea Description**  
Create a simple browser bookmarklet (one-click JavaScript bookmark) that automatically finds and selects the trainee role on the AWS login/role-switch page. It can search for keywords like "Trainee" in the role name and switch to it quickly. Share it as a drag-and-drop link in the trainee guide.

**FTE Benefits**  
- **Soft dollar benefit (human effort)**: Saves time on every login by avoiding manual role search.  
- **Estimated efforts saved**: 3-5 minutes per login, about 2-4 hours per month per trainee.  
- **Qualitative benefits**: Less frustration, fewer access errors, faster start to labs.  
- **Estimated BRC start**: Immediately after using the bookmarklet (e.g., December 2025).  

**Organization Benefits**  
- Reduces basic "access issues" queries from new trainees.  
- Improves training efficiency without policy changes.  

**Customer Benefits**  
- Not applicable (internal training tool).  

**Estimated hard dollar benefit**: $0  
**Estimated soft dollar benefit**: $80-150 annualized per trainee (time saved).  
**Estimated cost of investment**: 5-10 hours trainee time (no cost).  
**Estimated FTE release date**: Not applicable.  
**Hard dollar annualized revenue**: $0
